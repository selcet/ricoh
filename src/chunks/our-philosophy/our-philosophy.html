      We strongly believe that communication and accurate information
      are very important. No matter if there are good or bad news - you're
      up-to-date with everything. You can always call us or talk to us via
      dedicated Slack room which will be created for your project.<br/>
      <br/>
      As we work in agile methodologies, our development process is
      very simple and well defined - Backlog Refinements, Sprint Review,
      Planning, regular meetings.<br/>
      <br/>
      You have full access to both JIRA (Project Management system)
      and GIT Repos all the time. You can measure our progress on a
      daily basis - we want to be 100% clear with all we do.
